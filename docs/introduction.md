Introduction
========================================================

This <a href="http://shinyapps.io?kid=2B7XZ" target="_blank">ShinyApp</a> allows you to download and visualise crime data in England, Wales & Northern Ireland from <a href="http://data.police.uk" target="_blank">data.police.uk</a>. The data is made available under the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/" target="_blank">Open Government License</a>. For more information, see my original blog posts <a href="http://bit.ly/bib_crimemap_blog1" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/bib_crimemap_blog2" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/bib_crimemap_blog3" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you are interested in the historical development of this project, please have a look at my slides [http://bit.ly/londonr_crimemap](http://bit.ly/londonr_crimemap). I have also set up a new personal website, please check it out! [www.jofaichow.co.uk](http://www.jofaichow.co.uk)

## Quick Start

1. If this is your first visit, please leave the settings on the left panel alone (you can play with them later). 
2. Get yourself familiar with the outputs first.
3. Output One: Go to the "Data" tab to see some raw crime data (crimes around London Eye from the first six months in 2013 are preloaded).
4. Output Two: Go to "Heat Map" tab to see the crime heatmap.
5. Output Three: Go to "Trends" tab to see some simple bar charts illustrating the trends in different crime categories.
6. Now you have seen the three main output tabs. You are ready to create your own crime data visualisation. 
7. Simply enter a <b>location</b> of your choice (e.g. Oxford), choose the <b>first month</b> for data collection (e.g. Jan 2012), decide <b>how many months</b> of data you need and then click <b>"Update"</b>. 
8. There are more settings available for you to customise the plots. Scroll down and <b>try them out!</b>.
9. Other related news and articles can be found in the remaining tabs.
10. Enjoy!
